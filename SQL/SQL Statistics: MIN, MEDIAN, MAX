For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement. Your task is to calculate the MIN, MEDIAN and MAX scores of the students from the results table.

Tables and relationship below:

student-> id,name
result-> id, student_id, score

Resultant table:
min
median
max


/* SELECT max(r.score)  max, min(r.score) min
FROM result r JOIN student s ON s.id = r.student_id */



/* SELECT rank() over( order by r.score)  rank , ROW_NUMBER() over (order by r.score) row_number
FROM result r JOIN student s ON s.id = r.student_id */

/* SELECT rank() over( order by r.score)  rank , ROW_NUMBER() over (order by r.score) row_number, r.score score
FROM result r JOIN student s ON s.id = r.student_id */

/* SELECT score as median from (

SELECT rank() over( order by r.score)  rank , ROW_NUMBER() over (order by r.score) row_number, r.score score
FROM result r JOIN student s ON s.id = r.student_id

) as something where row_number = (50) */

SELECT something.rank, something.row_number, something.score from (

SELECT rank() over( order by r.score)  rank , ROW_NUMBER() over (order by r.score) row_number, r.score score
FROM result r JOIN student s ON s.id = r.student_id

) as something where row_number = (50)
